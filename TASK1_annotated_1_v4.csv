"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?","Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).","Since a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [1] [2] [3] [4] scientific interest in this family of viruses has increased dramatically. 5 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that cause a wide spectrum of disease in humans and animals. These viruses are divided into three distinct groups on the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) causes a mild form of the common cold and belongs to group 1, which includes the recently discovered human coronavirus NL63 6 and the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Human coronaviruses belonging to group 2 are OC43 and HKU1, the latter also having been discovered very recently. 7 The SARS coronavirus has been classified as an outlier of group 2. 8 Coronaviruses infecting birds have been identified as a separate group (group 3). 9 The genome of HCoV 229E consists of 27,277 nucleotides, comprising a total of eight open reading frames. The entire replicase complex of the virus is encoded within two large overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. ORF 1a codes for polyprotein 1a (pp1a) with a calculated molecular mass of 454 kDa. Involving a (?1) ribosomal frameshift, translation of ORF 1a and ORF 1b together yields the giant polypeptide 1ab (pp1ab) with a calculated molecular mass of 754 kDa. 10, 11 These polyproteins are processed by two virus-encoded papain-like proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ) 12 and the main proteinase (M pro , also called 3C-like protease, 3CL pro ), 13 resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps). The crystal structure of HCoV-229E M pro has been determined by our group 14 and shown to be similar to that of the homologous enzyme from TGEV. 15 The structure of the SARS-CoV M pro16, 17 is also very similar.",Variable Oligomerization Modes in Coronavirus Non-structural Protein 9,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.07.071
"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?","Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).","In February 2003 The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a new pathogen -a member of the coronavirus (CoV) family -is the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a mysterious atypical pneumonia that emerged in China's Guangdong province three months earlier. Over the next weeks, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe, resulting in over 8000 individuals becoming infected; 774 of which died. Currently, significant efforts in the area of SARS vaccine research are being made. Several neutralizing antibodies have been isolated and reported to prevent viral infection, mainly, via blocking the association between the viral spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin convertingenzyme 2 (ACE-2). Here we report the first steps toward identifying a major neutralizing epitope of SARS-CoV, using an original reverse immunological approach. According to this approach, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) serves as a template for the ultimate production of an epitope-based vaccine. In order to accomplish this task one must backtrack from the antibody of interest to its corresponding neutralizing epitope. Once identified, the epitope can be reconstituted and used to elicit antibodies with neutralizing activity characteristic of the original mAb. 80R [1] , is a highly potent neutralizing human anti-SARS mAb directed against the viral spike protein and has been used to affinity select panels of mAb specific peptides from phage displayed random peptide libraries. ""Mapitope"" [2] , a unique computer algorithm, uses these peptides as input and has enabled us to map the 80R epitope on the spike protein. In general, Map-itope prediction of an epitope is based on the notion that the panel of affinity selected peptides collectively represents the epitope of the mAb which they bind. More specifically, pairs of amino acids enriched in the peptide panels are taken to effectively represent surface accessible discontinuous pairs of residues of the epitope, juxtaposed in the antigen via protein folding. Two independent peptide-panels were analyzed against the crystalline structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike protein by Mapitope [3] . Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted as potential epitopes.

Precise knowledge of the incubation period would help to provide an optimal length of quarantine period for disease control purpose, and also is essential in the investigation of the mechanism of transmission and development of treatment. For example, the distribution of the incubation period is used to estimate the reproductive number ? , that is, the average number of secondary infections produced by a primary case. The reproductive number is a key quantity that impacts the potential size of an epidemic. Despite the importance of the incubation period, it is often poorly estimated based on limited data.",Estimation of incubation period distribution of COVID-19 using disease onset forward time: a novel cross-sectional and forward follow-up study,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417
"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?","Range of incubation periods for the disease in humans (and how this varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious, even after recovery.","Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [32, 33] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.","Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China. medRxiv",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026112

"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?","Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).","Recently, a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of an emerging disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . During its first outbreak in 2003, SARS led to at least 8000 infections and over 750 fatalities (Donnelly et al., 2003) . The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding a predicted 28 proteins (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , including several alternative ORFs. These occur in the 3 0 region of the genome, which encodes structural and accessory proteins that are involved in the assembly of the virus particle (see Figure 1) . Although the precise details of coronavirus assembly are not well understood, the consensus model is that the RNA genome is packaged in the cell cytoplasm by multiple copies of the relatively well conserved (Stadler et al., 2003) N-protein to form the nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid then associates with the viral membrane proteins M, S, and E in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, where virus particles assemble and bud into the Golgi. In SARS-CoV, as in other group 2 coronaviruses, an additional protein is synthesized (called ORF-9b in SARS-CoV and internal or I-protein otherwise) from an alternative reading frame of the N-gene. In BCV, the I-protein is produced in an exact molar ratio with the N-protein (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) and in MHV it is present in the assembled virion, suggesting that it acts as an accessory structural protein in viral assembly (Fischer et al., 1997) . The MHV I-protein is not essential for the production of viable virus; however, it does confer a selective advantage for virus growth (Fischer et al., 1997) . Although little is known about the equivalent protein in SARS Co-V, antibodies against ORF-9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection (Qiu et al., 2005) .","The Crystal Structure of ORF-9b, a Lipid Binding Protein from the SARS Coronavirus",0

"What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?","Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).","The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has also developed a strategy to overcome host innate immune defenses. The viral gene products derived from ORF3b, ORF6 and N protein were able to disrupt IFN-? production through inhibition of IRF3 [149] . Similarly, blocking IRF3 activation allows the nucleoprotein of the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (arenavirus) to antagonize the type I IFN response [150] . Another report showed that the sumoylation of IRF3 and IRF7 upon VSV infection leads to negative regulation of Type I IFN production [151] . Induction of type I IFNs can also be inhibited through the targeting of TLRs by some viruses. For instance, the NS3-4A protein of the HCV antagonizes the TLR3 pathway through the cleavage of the TLR-3 adaptor protein TRIF in the endosomal compartment [152] . Another interesting example is provided by the Vaccinia virus (VACV). It encodes two proteins, A46 and A52 that independently target distinct components of the TLR pathway and antagonize host innate antiviral responses. A46 interacts with the adaptor molecules MyD88, TRIF, and TRAM through its homotypic TIR domain and thereby interferes with the TLR-mediated pathways leading to IRF3 activation and type I IFN production [153] . A52 interrupts signal transmission leading to activation of NF-B by interacting with IRAK2 and TRAF6 [154] . Notably, infection of mice with a VACV lacking the A46R or A52R gene resulted in an attenuated phenotype, demonstrating their association with VACV virulence [153, 154] . Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the VACV virulence factor B14 disables pro-inflammatory responses by interacting with IKK?, thereby inhibiting NF-B activation [155] (Table 1) .","Current review Interferons: Signaling, antiviral and viral evasion",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2008.11.002

Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).","Coronavirus (CoV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positivesense RNA virus. Although respiratory CoVs are largely secreted by the nasal route, the role of fecal/oral transmission has not been fully explored. Earlier studies have demonstrated that CoV stability largely depends on environmental temperature (Ijaz et al., 1985; Siddell et al., 1983; Tennant et al., 1994) . CoVs are inactivated at 56 C within 10e15 min, at 37 C after several days, and at 4 C after several months. However, at À60 C, CoVs can survive for many years without loss of infectivity (Andries et al., 1978; McIntosh et al., 1974; Siddell et al., 1983) . Survival studies of human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and HCoV-OC43 demonstrated that both viruses survived in a saline solution up to 6 days at room temperature, but after drying on hospital surfaces, they survived as long as 3 h; although survival differences between the two viruses were observed (Sizun et al., 2000) .

In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Joel Koo and colleagues 3 assessed the potential effect of such social distancing interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19 burden in Singapore. The context is worthy of study, since Singapore was among the first settings to report imported cases, and has so far succeeded in preventing community spread. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in Singapore, numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented successfully, including effective triage and infection control measures in healthcare settings, isolation and quarantine of patients with SARS and their contacts, and mass screening of schoolaged children for febrile illness. 4 Each of these measures represented an escalation of typical public health action. However, the scale and disruptive impact of these interventions were small compared with the measures that have been implemented in China in response to COVID-19, including closure of schools, workplaces, roads, and transit systems; cancellation of public gatherings; mandatory quarantine of uninfected people without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and largescale electronic surveillance. 5, 6 Although these actions have been praised by WHO, 5 the possibility of imposing similar measures in other countries raises important questions. Populations for whom social-distancing interventions have been implemented require and deserve assurance that the decision to enact these measures is informed by the best attainable evidence.

In February 2007, the Community Strategy for Pandemic Infl uenza Mitigation was issued; it describes the early, targeted, and layered use of nonpharmaceutical interventions, coupled with specifi c uses of antiviral infl uenza medications, to reduce transmission of pandemic infl uenza and mitigate the disease (1) .Researchers differ over the potential effectiveness of such community mitigation measures. Evidence to determine the best strategies for protecting persons during a pandemic is limited. Several studies based on fi ndings from mathematical models and historical analyses suggest that early implementation of multiple measures, such as social distancing, school closures, and isolation of sick persons, may be effective in reducing the transmission of the virus (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Other researchers cite uncertainty (7) or believe such measures may not be effective (8, 9) .Community mitigation interventions include 1) isolation and treatment with infl uenza antiviral medications of all persons with confi rmed or probable pandemic infl uenza; 2) voluntary home quarantine of and provision of antiviral medications as prophylaxis to members of households with persons with confi rmed or probable infl uenza (if sufficient quantities of antiviral medications exist and a feasible means of distribution is in place); 3) dismissal of students from schools and closure of childcare facilities along with preventing the recongregation of children and teenagers in community settings; and 4) social distancing of adults in the community and workplace, which may include cancellation of large public gatherings and possible alteration of workplace environments and schedules to decrease social density. A great deal of cooperation from the public would be required to successfully implement community mitigation measures during a pandemic. Public reaction to an unfamiliar crisis is obviously diffi cult to predict. However, by using surveys that describe hypothetical scenarios, we can elicit potential responses of persons in these situations.

What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?,Public health mitigation measures that could be effective for control,"In concluding, it is apparent from all the results obtained for the different scenarios that we have considered that the most cost-effective strategy would be the isolation or quarantine of detected infectious cases, as long as the efficacy of such measure is over 60%. Important for the current debate about the natural history of the disease, this policy would also work if there is a fraction of asymptomatic but infectious individuals in the population. Our results also show that from a practical point of view, a combination of all the analyzed contexts can have second order benefits. As already stressed, containment measures should not only be directed towards a full cutdown of the number of infected cases. Their efficacy is also given by other factors, such as delaying, even if only by a few days, the spreading of the disease. Such delays are always good for preparedness and to have more time for clinical research that can lead to new pharmacological treatments or vaccines. For instance, even if traffic restrictions are not effective on their own, they facilitate the control of the population and thus it would be easier to detect infected individuals and treat them. Similarly, self-protection measures and other social-distancing practices delay the spreading of the disease, freeing resources that would allow for a better management of the epidemic, in turn leading to an increase of the efficacy of individual isolation. Closing public places would, in practice, reduce the transmission, which again will lower the total number of infections and thus make them more manageable for the public health system. This also highlights the importance of having a coordinated response system, since simply adopting central measures like imposing mobility restrictions and closing public places is not effective in the middle-to-long term.

First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases should be adjusted by the delay in time from illness onset to reporting. Second, assessing only confirmed cases among all infections can offer limited insights into the severity among all infected individuals. Third, ascertainment bias and IFR are reduced by a shorter virus detection window and lower RT-PCR sensitivity. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health officials will need to confront the uncertainty in the risk of death, and prompt identification of high-risk individuals using the approaches covered in this article is needed. Subjectively, COVID-19 involves mild infections among the general population, but the risk of death among young adults is higher than for seasonal influenza, and the mortality among older adults with comorbidities requires close attention.

Human mobility, air travel, and international trade can likely increase the number of cases in other regions as well. Continued surveillance along with the robust response of government agencies, medical practitioners, and researchers, is highly essential for the effective management of this emerging pathogen. Public health officials need to identify the source and virus reservoir, transmission cycle, pathogenesis, inter-human transmission, and clinical manifestations, which might be helpful to develop animal models, diagnostic reagents, anti-viral therapies, and vaccines against this pathogen. As the virus emerged suddenly and became a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid vaccine development. Although classical expression systems for biopharmaceutical proteins are still amenable, the development of transient expression in plants has deeply influenced the pharmaceutical sector to produce affordable vaccines and biologics rapidly at low cost. Hence, the plant expression platform shall be employed for biopharmaceutical production to accelerate the fight against this deadly infectious disease. The collaborative efforts of researchers are highly desirable to use a plant expression platform for producing an efficient cost-effective vaccine to control this epidemic. The continuous effort of research in this direction might be helpful in producing high-value biologics and pharmaceuticals on a large scale in a short time, especially during epidemics.

"What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?",Sustainable risk reduction strategies,"all contacts are traced and under active monitoring, since symptom onset is the event that triggers, with some delay, isolation. Mass quarantine is expected to result in prompt isolation upon symptom onset of any truly infected individuals, but the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 will depend heavily on whether presymptomatic exposure within the group is decreased or increased by the approach to confinement. That is, mass quarantine may reduce or increase the number of uninfected contacts exposed to presymptomatic infectiousness of those who do go on to develop the disease. In serial interval scenario 1, where a mean of 20% of transmission is expected to occur before symptom onset, the positive effect of prompt isolation can be offset by an increase in presymptomatic transmission in a confined space. Mass quarantines can also result in unintended consequences that can exacerbate transmission of COVID-19 such as avoidance of contact tracers and inaccurate recall, or other infectious diseases more broadly, such as a reduction in healthcare worker support, availability of supplies, or high-density settings. 20 The impact of travel restrictions on human mobility, a necessary first step in the causal chain to outbreak containment, is difficult to measure, but the impact has been documented in Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 epidemic of Ebola Virus Disease. 21 The conflicting conclusions from our two scenarios, driven largely by the differences in the extent of presymptomatic transmission, highlight the urgent need for more data to clarify key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19, particularly the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission, in order to inform response efforts. These highly influential parameters warrant further study to improve data-driven policy-making. In addition, our choice to consider shifts of the latent period relative to the infectious period implicitly assumes a similar shape to the underlying distributions, albeit with different means. As the amount of asymptomatic transmission will depend not only on the average timing of latent period relative to the incubation period, but also on the standard deviation of these distributions, more data on their true shapes is urgently needed.

"What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?",Sustainable risk reduction strategies,"With the advent of new and broader spectrum antibiotics, improved environmental hygiene, and advances in microbiological techniques it was widely expected that the need for diagnosis of infectious agents in tissue would diminish in importance. This assumption underestimated the infinite capacity of infectious agents for genomic variation, enabling them to develop antimicrobial resistance and exploit new opportunities to spread infections which are created when host defenses become compromised. The following are currently the most important factors influencing the presentation of infectious diseases:  The increased mobility of the world's population through tourism, immigration and inter national commerce has distorted natural geographic boundaries to infection, exposing weaknesses in host defenses, and in knowledge.  Immunodeficiency states occurring either as part of an infection, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or as an iatrogenic disease. As treatment becomes more aggressive, depression of the host's immunity occurs, enabling organisms of low virulence to become life-threatening, and may allow latent infections, accrued throughout life, to reactivate and spread.  Emerging, re-emerging and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylococcus are a constant and growing threat.  Adaptive mutation occurring in microorganisms allows them to jump species barriers and exploit new physical environments. Such adaptation allows infections to evade host defenses and resist agents of treatment.  Bioterrorism has become an increasing concern.

Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). One of the goals of the GSCID is high throughput sequencing of various viral pathogens. The viral genome sequencing projects at JCVI have resulted in publication of more than 4000 influenza virus genomes from clinical and animal reservoir specimens, and hundreds of coronavirus and rotavirus sequences. Prediction of protein coding genes encoded in these viral genomes is a critical step to understanding these pathogenic viruses. In order to have a flexible, accurate gene prediction tool for utilization in high throughput viral genome sequencing projects, we developed a viral annotation program, VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader). VIGOR uses a similarity-based approach to detect open reading frames (ORF) in various viral genomes by similarity searches against custom reference protein sequence databases. VIGOR takes into account differences between the genomic structures of viral taxonomic groups. VIGOR is tailored for the designated viruses with complex gene features such as splicing and frame-shifting, and it is able to predict genes accurately in influenza (group A, B, and C), coronavirus (including SARS coronavirus), rhinovirus, and rotavirus genomes. It was also designed to assign function to the predicted ORFs and genotype influenza viruses. In addition to gene prediction, VIGOR can also be used as a tool to validate sequence accuracy and completeness during the genome finishing process.

Typically, sequence analysis is performed on a collection of biological sequences that are assumed to share an evolutionary relationship. However, the flood of publicly available and newly generated pathogen sequences annotated with host organism, time of isolation and country of origin have opened up the possibility of incorporating these parameters in the study of microbial pathogen evolution. Sheng et al. [24] have recently shown how geographical and time information in public biological databases could be integrated with pattern-mining algorithms to study antigenic changes in influenza A viruses. The likelihood of one virus being able to mutate into another form is dependent on whether they exist within a certain time period, the connectivity between the locations where they were collected and their sequence similarity. The method was used to trace the evolution trajectory of H5N1, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Asia, the USA and Europe at different time points. Attempts to unify the epidemiological and evolutionary processes that drive spatio-temporal incidence and phylogenetic patterns at different scales have also been reported. For instance, Grenfell et al. [25] introduced a phylodynamic framework to study how pathogen genetic variation -modulated by host immunity, transmission bottlenecks and epidemic dynamics -affects the diversity of epidemiological and phylogenetic patterns in measles, influenza A viruses, HIV, dengue and hepatitis C virus.

"What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?",Animal host(s) and any evidence of continued spill-over to humans,"We have shown that human SARS-CoV can infect domesticated mammals, in particular, the pig. The direct source of SARS-CoV transmission to the identified infected pigs was most likely virus-contaminated animal feed because the farm where the infected pig was identified is rather remote, >1 km from the nearest village. The only person routinely in close contact with the animals is the swineherd, whose serum samples were negative for SARS-CoV on all tests. Swineherds in rural areas often obtain leftovers from restaurants in the cities for use as hogwash (without thoroughly fermenting it). Thus, even if no direct evidence for human-to-swine SARS-CoV transmission exists, a strong warning should be issued to prevent such a practice, or regulatory procedures should be instituted to block this route of disease propagation (15) . Whether or not other domesticated (such as dogs and cats) and wild animals that are common in and around human settlements can easily contract and pass on SARS-CoV remains to be seen in future studies. Intensive surveillance and investigations on animals, especially during and after an outbreak of SARS, will lead to a better understanding and ability to control this disease's natural animal reservoirs and to prevent interspecies transmission events.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends placing patients with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). 21 If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) ""case-based"" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) ""non-case-based"" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption.","Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042705

Inactivated whole virus vaccines are immunogenic and protective in animal models. However, this approach requires the production of a large amount of infectious virus in a biosafety level 3 containment facility, which is not widely available among vaccine manufacturers. Because the S protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, it is a priority target for the development of subunit vaccines. Full-length S protein delivered in the form of DNA vaccine, or expressed in attenuated vaccinia virus or recombinant baculovirus systems, have been to shown to induce T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and have been found to be protective in challenge studies. 124, 126, 164, 165 However, there are concerns about using full-length S protein as a vaccine, because harmful immune responses causing liver damage in vaccinated animals have been reported. 166 The possibility of enhanced disease, as observed in vaccinated cats on infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus, is also a concern. 167,168 Theoretically, antibodies present at low concentrations may form complexes with virions, and be taken up by macrophage via the Fc receptors expressed on its surface. This process enhances virus dissemination and may lead to adverse outcomes. Vaccines based on a partial S protein or other structural proteins of SARS-CoV have been explored.

Major strategies for vaccine development are focused on the elicitation of serum antibodies against the major antigen (S protein) of MERS-CoV . Further, passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma is being considered in MERS patients after its success in animal models . However, studies also demonstrate that MERS-CoV S protein-derived vaccines induce specific CD8 þ T-cell and virus-neutralizing antibodies, which could contribute to complete protection against MERS-CoV in animal models (Lan et al., 2014; Volz et al., 2015) . Based on the investigations of immune memory against SARS-CoV in follow-up studies of recovered patients (discussed above), T-cell responses can provide robust long-term memory and possess a considerable potential for cross-reactivity with heterotypic coronaviruses. Thus, vaccines combining both cellular and humoral responses should be considered for coronavirus prevention.

Although some of these candidates can induce high levels of nAbs in vaccinated animals and have entered phase 1 clinical trials [15] [16] [17] , most of these candidates are associated with low immunogenicity requiring multiple doses [18] . Importantly, vaccine research on other members of the coronaviruses including SARS-CoV [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] revealed several safety concerns associated with the use of S-based vaccines, including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody (Ab)-mediated disease enhancement following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals. Recently, we also showed that whole inactivated MERS-CoV vaccine (WIV) is associated with significantly increased pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration accompanied by elevated levels of Th2 cytokines in vaccinated human DPP4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg + ) mice in response to virus challenge [28] . Given these previous observations, a MERS-CoV vaccine based on the full-length S protein could pose potential safety concerns similar to those associated with SARS-CoV vaccines.

Our results are consistent with earlier reports suggesting that zoonotic viruses are highly resistant to neutralization with antiserum directed against epidemic strains like Urbani. 21 Importantly, VRP vaccines elicited high levels of neutralizing antiserum against the homologous isolate, but less efficient neutralizing responses against the icGD03-S recombinant virus. These high neutralizing responses likely translated to efficient protection from homologous infection, both in young and aged mice, but also provided short-term protection against homologous protection in younger animals. In aged animals, responses had waned or elderly immune systems had deteriorated sufficiently to allow for robust icGD03 replication and pathogenesis. 13, 14 It is likely that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralizing responses like DNA and killed vaccines, might completely fail in protecting against icGD03 challenge. To rectify this problem, booster vaccines should be considered in senescent populations or new vaccine formulations be assembled that include S glycoprotein determinants that protect against epidemic and zoonotic forms of SARS-CoV. Future studies will evaluate single VRP regiments that include either the VRP-S or VRP-N candidate vaccines separately, as this approach may enhance overall protection in VRP-S vaccinated animals. Clearly, the availability of SARS-CoV strains harboring zoonotic S glycoproteins will provide important future reference inoculums for evaluating the robustness of new vaccine candidates in animals.",SARS CORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124095/

It is believed that induction of Th2-polarized immune response and/or non-neutralizing Abs against epitopes within the S protein (i.e. outside the neutralizing-epitope rich RBD or S1 subunit) are the reason for the observed immunopathology and disease enhancement in vaccinated animals [46] [47] [48] , suggesting that use of S1 subunit over full-length S protein could be a safer option for vaccine development.",Immunogenicity of Candidate MERS-CoV DNA Vaccines Based on the Spike Protein OPEN,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362948/
What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?,Efforts to develop animal models and standardize challenge studies,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption. Adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogenesis of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. We report the first findings of measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with SARS-CoV.,Cynomolgus Macaque as an Animal Model for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435788/
What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?,Clinical and bench trials to investigate less common viral inhibitors against COVID-19,"Given the scale and rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease, there is an immediate need for medicines that can help before a vaccine can be produced. Results of rapid sequencing of 2019-nCoV, coupled with molecular modelling based on the genomes of related virus proteins, 1 have suggested a few compounds that are likely to be effective, including the anti-HIV lopinavir plus ritonavir combination.
