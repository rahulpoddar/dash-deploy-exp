Precise knowledge of the incubation period would help to provide an optimal length of quarantine period for disease control purpose, and also is essential in the investigation of the mechanism of transmission and development of treatment. For example, the distribution of the incubation period is used to estimate the reproductive number ? , that is, the average number of secondary infections produced by a primary case. The reproductive number is a key quantity that impacts the potential size of an epidemic. Despite the importance of the incubation period, it is often poorly estimated based on limited data.",,

Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.",,

A novel human coronavirus that is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly called HCoV-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and is now causing a pandemic.1 We analyzed the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus.2

We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on various surfaces and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian regression model (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). SARS-CoV-2 nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) and SARS-CoV-1 Tor2 (AY274119.3) were the strains used. Aerosols (<5 ?m) containing SARS-CoV-2 (105.25 50% tissue-culture infectious dose [TCID50] per milliliter) or SARS-CoV-1 (106.75-7.00 TCID50 per milliliter) were generated with the use of a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum to create an aerosolized environment. The inoculum resulted in cycle-threshold values between 20 and 22, similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans.
","'Since a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [1] [2] [3] [4] scientific interest in this family of viruses has increased dramatically. 5 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that cause a wide spectrum of disease in humans and animals. These viruses are divided into three distinct groups on the basis of genome organization and phylogenetic analysis. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) causes a mild form of the common cold and belongs to group 1, which includes the recently discovered human coronavirus NL63 6 and the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Human coronaviruses belonging to group 2 are OC43 and HKU1, the latter also having been discovered very recently. 7 The SARS coronavirus has been classified as an outlier of group 2. 8 Coronaviruses infecting birds have been identified as a separate group (group 3). 9 The genome of HCoV 229E consists of 27,277 nucleotides, comprising a total of eight open reading frames. The entire replicase complex of the virus is encoded within two large overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. ORF 1a codes for polyprotein 1a (pp1a) with a calculated molecular mass of 454 kDa. Involving a (?1) ribosomal frameshift, translation of ORF 1a and ORF 1b together yields the giant polypeptide 1ab (pp1ab) with a calculated molecular mass of 754 kDa. 10, 11 These polyproteins are processed by two virus-encoded papain-like proteases (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ) 12 and the main proteinase (M pro , also called 3C-like protease, 3CL pro ), 13 resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps). The crystal structure of HCoV-229E M pro has been determined by our group 14 and shown to be similar to that of the homologous enzyme from TGEV. 15 The structure of the SARS-CoV M pro16, 17 is also very similar.'",,

","'Recently, a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of an emerging disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . During its first outbreak in 2003, SARS led to at least 8000 infections and over 750 fatalities (Donnelly et al., 2003) . The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding a predicted 28 proteins (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , including several alternative ORFs. These occur in the 3 0 region of the genome, which encodes structural and accessory proteins that are involved in the assembly of the virus particle (see Figure 1) . Although the precise details of coronavirus assembly are not well understood, the consensus model is that the RNA genome is packaged in the cell cytoplasm by multiple copies of the relatively well conserved (Stadler et al., 2003) N-protein to form the nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid then associates with the viral membrane proteins M, S, and E in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, where virus particles assemble and bud into the Golgi. In SARS-CoV, as in other group 2 coronaviruses, an additional protein is synthesized (called ORF-9b in SARS-CoV and internal or I-protein otherwise) from an alternative reading frame of the N-gene. In BCV, the I-protein is produced in an exact molar ratio with the N-protein (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) and in MHV it is present in the assembled virion, suggesting that it acts as an accessory structural protein in viral assembly (Fischer et al., 1997) . The MHV I-protein is not essential for the production of viable virus; however, it does confer a selective advantage for virus growth (Fischer et al., 1997) . Although little is known about the equivalent protein in SARS Co-V, antibodies against ORF-9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection (Qiu et al., 2005) .'",,

","'In February 2003 The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a new pathogen -a member of the coronavirus (CoV) family -is the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a mysterious atypical pneumonia that emerged in China\'s Guangdong province three months earlier. Over the next weeks, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe, resulting in over 8000 individuals becoming infected; 774 of which died. Currently, significant efforts in the area of SARS vaccine research are being made. Several neutralizing antibodies have been isolated and reported to prevent viral infection, mainly, via blocking the association between the viral spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin convertingenzyme 2 (ACE-2). Here we report the first steps toward identifying a major neutralizing epitope of SARS-CoV, using an original reverse immunological approach. According to this approach, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) serves as a template for the ultimate production of an epitope-based vaccine. In order to accomplish this task one must backtrack from the antibody of interest to its corresponding neutralizing epitope. Once identified, the epitope can be reconstituted and used to elicit antibodies with neutralizing activity characteristic of the original mAb. 80R [1] , is a highly potent neutralizing human anti-SARS mAb directed against the viral spike protein and has been used to affinity select panels of mAb specific peptides from phage displayed random peptide libraries. ""Mapitope"" [2] , a unique computer algorithm, uses these peptides as input and has enabled us to map the 80R epitope on the spike protein. In general, Map-itope prediction of an epitope is based on the notion that the panel of affinity selected peptides collectively represents the epitope of the mAb which they bind. More specifically, pairs of amino acids enriched in the peptide panels are taken to effectively represent surface accessible discontinuous pairs of residues of the epitope, juxtaposed in the antigen via protein folding. Two independent peptide-panels were analyzed against the crystalline structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike protein by Mapitope [3] . Three clusters (A, B and C) were predicted as potential epitopes. Cluster A ranked the highest, and is currently being considered for reconstitution and epitope based vaccine production.'",,

The inoculum resulted in cycle-threshold values between 20 and 22, similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans.
","'The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has also developed a strategy to overcome host innate immune defenses. The viral gene products derived from ORF3b, ORF6 and N protein were able to disrupt IFN-? production through inhibition of IRF3 [149] . Similarly, blocking IRF3 activation allows the nucleoprotein of the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (arenavirus) to antagonize the type I IFN response [150] . Another report showed that the sumoylation of IRF3 and IRF7 upon VSV infection leads to negative regulation of Type I IFN production [151] . Induction of type I IFNs can also be inhibited through the targeting of TLRs by some viruses. For instance, the NS3-4A protein of the HCV antagonizes the TLR3 pathway through the cleavage of the TLR-3 adaptor protein TRIF in the endosomal compartment [152] . Another interesting example is provided by the Vaccinia virus (VACV). It encodes two proteins, A46 and A52 that independently target distinct components of the TLR pathway and antagonize host innate antiviral responses. A46 interacts with the adaptor molecules MyD88, TRIF, and TRAM through its homotypic TIR domain and thereby interferes with the TLR-mediated pathways leading to IRF3 activation and type I IFN production [153] . A52 interrupts signal transmission leading to activation of NF-B by interacting with IRAK2 and TRAF6 [154] . Notably, infection of mice with a VACV lacking the A46R or A52R gene resulted in an attenuated phenotype, demonstrating their association with VACV virulence [153, 154] . Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the VACV virulence factor B14 disables pro-inflammatory responses by interacting with IKK?, thereby inhibiting NF-B activation [155] (Table 1) .'",,

'''","Countermeasure development. Advancements in our capabilities to sequence viral genomes are changing the way we counteract global pandemics and acts of bioterrorism. There are two important aspects of countermeasure development that can benefit strongly from the availability of genome sequences and HT sequencing data: the detection of the infectious agent and the treatment of the disease caused by the agent. Taxonomic classification and detection through DNA/RNA-based inclusivity assays (i.e., using techniques such as PCR to detect the presence of a pathogen) can be designed using fragmented and incomplete genomes (e.g., SD and HQ sequences). Fully resolved ORFs (CC) further enable the development of immunological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA), for protein-based detection, and obtaining a complete genome opens the door to a plethora of additional downstream applications, including the design of exclusivity tests, the establishment of reverse genetics systems, and the design of robust forensics protocols. However, for effective development and testing of animal models, therapeutics, vaccines, and prophylactics, it is necessary to obtain a complete picture of the variability present within both the challenge stock and postinfection populations, thereby necessitating finished genomes.

'''","Till date the genome sequence of many virus species and their hosts is known and a range of novel tools has become available to study virus-host interactions at the molecular level. The advent of genomics tools provides us with an unprecedented view on the 'host-side' of this interaction. Together with advances in high-throughput technology, bioinformatics, and statistics this progress allows us to assess gene expression controlling the host response to viral infections in a genome wide fashion. With the latest generations of microarrays this can be achieved at the mRNA level with one single microarray. Microarray technology also extends to genotyping of the host (SNP analysis), and diagnostics by the identification of imprints in the host transcriptome characteristic for certain clinical conditions. In addition recent progress in the field of proteomics allows for the measurement of the expression levels of hundreds of proteins in a single biological sample, for example by mass spectrometry. Consequently, the 'genomics revolution' offers high-through-put tools to study the complex virus-host interaction with changing expression levels of many genes and gene pathways as a direct function of viral and host genome properties.

'''","Genomic and epidemiological monitoring have become an integral part of our response to emerging and ongoing epidemics of viral infectious diseases. Advances in high-throughput sequencing, including portable genomic sequencing at reduced costs and turnaround time, are paralleled by continuing developments in methodology to infer evolutionary histories (dynamics/patterns) and to identify factors driving viral spread in space and time. The traditionally static nature of visualizing phylogenetic trees that represent these evolutionary relationships/processes has also evolved, albeit perhaps at a slower rate. Advanced visualization tools with increased resolution assist in drawing conclusions from phylogenetic estimates and may even have potential to better inform public health and treatment decisions, but the design (and choice of what analyses are shown) is hindered by the complexity of information embedded within current phylogenetic models and the integration of available meta-data. In this review, we discuss visualization challenges for the interpretation and exploration of reconstructed histories of viral epidemics that arose from increasing volumes of sequence data and the wealth of additional data layers that can be integrated. We focus on solutions that address joint temporal and spatial visualization but also consider what the future may bring in terms of visualization and how this may become of value for the coming era of real-time digital pathogen surveillance, where actionable results and adequate intervention strategies need to be obtained within days.",0.47112238,

PCR approaches for targeted whole genome sequencing, in contrast to random amplification, can preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental nucleic acids [16, 17] potentially focusing sequencing on the virus of interest. To date, the largest dataset of HMPV whole genomes (n = 61) sequenced from any tropical country is from three Peruvian cities, Lima, Piura and Iquitos [18] . In Africa, apart from one metapneumovirus genome identified from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda (GenBank accession number HM197719), there are no HMPV genomes reported according to the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, http://www.viprbrc. org/, accessed April 30, 2019). This has led to limited understanding of the genetic and genomic diversity of HMPV in the continent.",0.4719203,

The direct source of SARS-CoV transmission to the identified infected pigs was most likely virus-contaminated animal feed because the farm where the infected pig was identified is rather remote, >1 km from the nearest village. The only person routinely in close contact with the animals is the swineherd, whose serum samples were negative for SARS-CoV on all tests. Swineherds in rural areas often obtain leftovers from restaurants in the cities for use as hogwash (without thoroughly fermenting it). Thus, even if no direct evidence for human-to-swine SARS-CoV transmission exists, a strong warning should be issued to prevent such a practice, or regulatory procedures should be instituted to block this route of disease propagation (15) . Whether or not other domesticated (such as dogs and cats) and wild animals that are common in and around human settlements can easily contract and pass on SARS-CoV remains to be seen in future studies. Intensive surveillance and investigations on animals, especially during and after an outbreak of SARS, will lead to a better understanding and ability to control this disease's natural animal reservoirs and to prevent interspecies transmission events.

Therefore, it is important to detect subclinical infected animals in non-case farms. Our findings show a significant difference between not only infectious status (case/non-case farms), but also production type (FF/WF).

Although inactivated virus vaccines can offer effective prevention, there are associated residual risk issues, including incomplete virus inactivation and escape during the vaccine production process [82] [83] [84] . Therefore, genetically engineered vaccines are considered more suitable options to overcome these shortcomings of inactivated viral vaccines. The EV VP1 protein is located outside the viral membrane and is thus exposed to the greatest amount of immune stress. Accordingly, VP1 shows an extreme serological variability, thus providing the most reliable molecular epidemiological information. Consequently, the VP1 region of EV71 has become a focus of vaccine research for picornavirus infections [84] . However, DNA constructs containing the VP1 gene of EV71 showed low levels of antigenicity. Therefore, there is still a need to develop an effective adjuvant strategy to increase the antigenicity. One possibility in this regard is the use of recombinant vaccines incorporating the 2B gene to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.",0.30516383,

However, over the decade there has been great acceleration in the advancement of modern molecular techniques and the compilation of genomic data of many pathogens. Such advances provide a great opportunity to create desirable vaccine strains which are less dangerous but more effectively immunogenic than those of vaccines achieved by classical methods. It is well established that the immune system has several effector mechanisms to cope with various pathogens, which would be dependent on their lifecycle and the microenvironment of the infected host. Since killed vaccines are still mainly used for livestock, it is absolutely necessary to develop novel adjuvants in order to enhance satisfactory immunity for such vaccines. Potent adjuvants should be able to effectively elicit cellular immunity in animals that are vaccinated with less immunogenic vaccines including killed or subunit vaccines. The other way to resolve this issue would be to develop a new delivery system, such as plasmid DNA, liposome, microparticles, and live viral or bacterial vectors, which can introduce vaccine antigens into intracellular compartments. Another notable advancement in immunology is the increased recognition on the major roles of innate immunity in vaccine adjuvant functions, which is often ignored despite their significant influence on vaccine developments. Recently discovered innate immunity receptors are screened as new adjuvant materials having activities, and they are used for inducing or enhancing vaccine reactions. Currently many types of adjuvants are in use for animal vaccines.",0.34041327,

We assume the vaccine is continuously administered directly to a fraction, ?, of newborn animals. Although this may be difficult to accomplish in many wild animal populations, it may be possible using the distribution of baits or by directly vaccinating and releasing animals reared in captivity.

Upon recovery, previously infected animals develop lifelong immunity against the target pathogen (hence against the vaccine). The degree of cross-immunity between viral vector and intact vaccine has been shown to influence the efficacy of recombinant vector transmissible vaccines . Here, we study two models that capture the extreme ends of the cross-immunity spectrum. In the first model, we assume a complete absence of cross-immunity; the dynamics of vaccine and vector are independent of each other (Figure 1a ).
